There are two files that cover the methodology for capturing data on enslaved persons from Union Hill Plantations from 1760-1865.
The first is a power point summary of the methodology from transcription to Jupyter notebooks
The second file is the Jupyter notebook showing the python code used to compile, clean and export the final csv for use in the Journal of Slavery and Data Preservation.
